# WaffleGenerator

Produces text which, on first glance, looks like real, ponderous, prose; replete with clich√©s.

Example content:

```
The Aesthetic Of Economico-Social Disposition

"In this regard, the underlying surrealism of the take home message should not 
divert attention from The Aesthetic Of Economico-Social Disposition"
(Humphrey Yokomoto in The Journal of the Total Entative Item (20044U))

On any rational basis, a particular factor, such as the functional baseline, the 
analogy of object, the strategic requirements or the principal overriding programming 
provides an interesting insight into the complementary functional derivation. 
This trend may dissipate due to the mensurable proficiency.
```

This output can be used in similar way to [Lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) content, in that it is useful for producing text for build software and producing design mockups.
